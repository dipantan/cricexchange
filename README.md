# Express TypeScript Starter

This is a starter template for building an Express.js application using TypeScript.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Write your server-side code in TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience.
- **Express.js**: Use the popular Express.js framework for building web applications and APIs.
- **Dependency Management**: Uses npm for managing project dependencies.
- **Scripts**: Pre-configured npm scripts for building and running the application.
